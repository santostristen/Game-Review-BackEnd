# Game Review Client Back End

The API for the Game Review Client [front end.](https://github.com/santostristen/Game-Reviews-Client) This API allows me to use all of the functionality from my front end application. Deployed using [Heroku](https://calm-badlands-37817.herokuapp.com/).

# Planning

Used express with mongodb and mongoose to set up routes for my user's reviews using express router. I went thorugh and got four CRUD routes running starting at creating a review then I moved onto showing all reviews. Then after the create and read functions I moved onto the update and delete functions.

# Technologies Used

1. Express
2. Passport
3. Express Router
4. MongoDB
5. Mongoose

# Future Plans

In the future I would like to add a route to be able to see just one specific review.
